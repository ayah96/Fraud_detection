# Credit Card Fraud Detection Based on Machine and Deep Learning
## Overview
we present our approach to predict legitimate or fraud transactions on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset provided by Kaggel. Our model is BiLSTM- MaxPooling-BiGRU-MaxPooling which based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional Gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). We also applied six machine learning classifiers which are: Na√Øve base, Voting, Ada boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Comparing the results from machine learning classifiers and our model theresults show that our model achieved better as we got 91.37% score.
